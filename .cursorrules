# Static Assets Rules
- All static assets go in the `static/` directory
- Follow the 7-1 SCSS pattern in `static/src/scss/`
- Place images in `static/assets/images/` organized by type
- JavaScript goes in `static/src/js/` organized by purpose
- Always run `npm run build` in `static/` directory before committing
- Use `{% static 'path/to/asset' %}` in Django templates
- Run `python manage.py collectstatic` after building assets
