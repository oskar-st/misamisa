# Cart Bug Fix Summary

## Problem
When a user logs out and then stock is reduced in admin, the cart appears empty instead of showing the reduced quantities.

## Root Cause
The `sync_cart_on_logout()` function was clearing the session cart, so after logout the user had no cart data. When they returned to the cart page, it was empty instead of validating against current stock.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Modified `sync_cart_on_logout()` in `shop/cart_utils.py`
- **Before**: Cart was cleared from session on logout
- **After**: Cart is saved to database but kept in session for anonymous browsing

### 2. Enhanced cart validation in `shop/views.py`
- **Before**: Cart validation only happened for authenticated users
- **After**: Cart validation happens for all users (with error handling)
- Added try/catch to prevent crashes if validation fails

## Files Modified
- `shop/cart_utils.py` - Line ~155 (sync_cart_on_logout function)
- `shop/views.py` - Line ~240 (cart validation in cart_view)

## Testing
1. Add items to cart while logged in
2. Log out 
3. Reduce stock in admin
4. Return to cart page
5. **Expected**: Cart shows reduced quantities with appropriate messages
6. **Previous**: Cart was empty

## Manual Server Restart
If the server needs to be restarted, run:
```bash
bash start_server.sh
```

This will kill any existing Django processes and start the server fresh.
